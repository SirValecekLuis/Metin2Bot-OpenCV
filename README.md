This project is only for fun and uses OpenCV to make bot for Metin2 game.

I have no intentions to break rules and do malicious stuff. I take this as a motivation to learn something new and fun.

There is "screen.png" which is not included and that's because it would leak my screenshot from the game and therefore my name as well.

for installing pydirectinput use 

pip install pydirectinput-rgx
